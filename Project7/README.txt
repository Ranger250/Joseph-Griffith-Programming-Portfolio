# Title: Jumper Evolution          
-------------------------

A program that shows how evolution and machine learning work. 
The program periodically spawns in a "generation" of rabits that jump and flail around. 
It then takes the one that got the highest, copies it's code over to every new rabbit, and varies each instance a little bit.
