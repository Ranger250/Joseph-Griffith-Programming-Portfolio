# Installations

python 3.0 or later

# Use
-------------------------

The player that spawns in the top left uses WASD to move and the player that spawns in the bottom right uses arrow keys.
You eat pellets to grow bigger and get faster. If the two players collide, the bigger one wins.
There are three kinds of power-ups, red, gold, and green.
Red makes your opponents controls backwards, gold gives more points, and green swaps the players controls.
For example if a green pellet gets eaten, the WASD player has to switch to arrow keys and vice versa.
